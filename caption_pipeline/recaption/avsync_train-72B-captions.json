A black plastic feeder sits at the rooster's feet, its smooth surface contrasting with the rough texture of the shavings. The rooster's beak opens and closes rhythmically, revealing its tongue and the inner workings of its throat as it vocalizes, its head bobbing gently with each movement. In the background, a wall adorned with a red logo featuring a stylized pig adds a splash of color to the otherwise neutral tones of the room. The camera maintains a steady, medium shot, capturing the rooster from the front, allowing viewers to observe every detail of its plumage and behavior. As the rooster shifts its weight from one leg to the other, its claws grip the wire mesh firmly, creating slight vibrations that ripple through the cage. The rooster's tail feathers fan out slightly, adding to its regal appearance. The scene is rendered in a photorealistic style, with high-definition clarity that highlights the intricate textures of the rooster's feathers and the fine strands of the wire mesh, all under the warm, even lighting that enhances the natural colors of the scene.",
